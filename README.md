#JCDP

**Java Colored Debug Printer** (JCDP) is a Java library that offers you a convenient way to print colored messages or debug messages on a terminal.

###Documentation

More information about how to use this library can be found at http://diogonunes.com/it/work/jcdp/. If you want to read the *javadoc* you can check the `doc` folder or read it online at http://diogonunes.com/it/work/jcdp/doc/index.html.

###Future Work

- Create a FilePrinter, an implementation that prints to a file rather than a terminal.
